# Interactive single-cell RNA-seq vulcano-plot exploration app

I created this app to enable quicker exploration of vulcano-plots between clusters/groups of scRNAseq datasets.

The app is written in python using and bokeh (pybiz). I use scanpy to deal with the data. Statistics are mostly done using pandas and numpy.
The panel (pyviz ecosystem) has been updated since I made this app, and it would be significantly easier to use their higher-level api (the build on top of bokeh) next time.

The code here is given without data, since I do not have the right to redistribute it. This means that the code cannot actually run.
