# Interactive single-cell RNA-seq vulcano-plot exploration app

I created this app to enable quicker exploration of vulcano-plots between clusters/groups of scRNAseq datasets.

The app is written in python using panel (pyviz) and bokeh. I use scanpy to deal with the data. Statistics are mostly done using pandas and numpy.
